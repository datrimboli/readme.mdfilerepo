# readme.mdfilerepo

In this assignment, we created a README generator

Upon running the app, the user will be presented with a series of questions and prompts to enter information about their project.  The questions and prompts are as follows:

-What is the title of your project?
-How would you describe your project?
-Please enter the installation instructions for your project.
-Please provide the usage information of your project.
-What are the contribution guidelines to your project?
-What are the test instructions of your project?
-What is your Github username?
-What is your email address?
-Which type of license does your application use?

Once the user has answered the questions and prompts, there will be a newreadme.md file created describing the project complete with a badge icon, a table of elements that allows easy navigation to the different sections of the read me (via click), sectioned answers, and project contact information. 

This provides an easy way to construct a concise & aesthetically pleasing README; an essential part to any project.
